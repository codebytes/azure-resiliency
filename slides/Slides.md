# Reliability

![bg right:65%](./img/sb-reliability.jpg)

---

# Why Reliability Matters

> A system is considered "reliable" if it can consistently serve users under normal or abnormal conditions.

- Reliability in distributed systems involves:
  - **Consistent performance** despite failures.
  - **Graceful degradation** when certain components become unavailable.
  - **Rapid recovery** within acceptable time limits.

---

# Understanding Reliability and Resiliency

- Failures are **inevitable** in distributed systems
- Workloads must **detect**, **withstand**, and **recover** from failures within _**acceptable**_ timeframes
- Ensuring availability for users to access workloads as promised
- Failures impact _**revenue**_, _**reputation**_, and _**customer trust**_

---

# <!-- fit --> FAILURE IS ALWAYS AN OPTION

---

## Financial Impact of Downtime

- **Revenue Loss**: Downtime can cost businesses over $1 million per hour, especially for e-commerce and online services.
- **Increased Expenses**: Includes emergency maintenance, staff overtime, and potential penalties for SLA breaches.
- **Legal Liabilities**: Potential lawsuits from customers or clients affected by downtime.
- **Insurance Challenges**: Downtime can affect insurance coverage and premiums.
- **Operational Costs**: Additional costs for restoring systems, data recovery, and preventive measures to avoid future downtime.

---

## Real-World Downtime Costs

- **77 hours** (≈3 days) median annual downtime for high-impact outages
- **$146 million** median annual cost of outages
- **30%** of engineering time spent addressing disruptions
  - Equals **12 hours** per engineer weekly (based on 40-hour week)

# How Do We Measure Reliability?

| SLI (Measure) | SLO (Target) | Error Budget (Allowable Failure) | SLA (External Commitment) |
|---------------|--------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Service Level Indicator | Service Level Objective | 1 - SLO (consumable failure/time) | Service Level Agreement |
| Metric of user experience (e.g., success %, p95 latency) | Reliability goal over window (e.g., 99.9% / 30d) | Remaining time/requests that may fail before action | Contract / credits / penalties |
| Assess actual service quality | Define acceptable reliability | Govern release pace & risk appetite | Formalize promises & remedies |
| API success rate per request | 99.95% successful responses (30d) | 0.05% errors ≈21.9 min @ 99.95% | 99.9% monthly availability w/ credits |

---

![SLA Pyramid](./img/sla-slo-sli.png)

# Understanding RPOs and RTOs

- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: Maximum acceptable downtime before services must be restored
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: Maximum acceptable data loss during a disruption

---

# Single Points of Failure (SPOFs)

<div class="columns">
<div>

## Understanding SPOFs

- Single component whose failure halts critical flow
- Occur in infra, data, code paths, people/process
- Early detection reduces mean time to mitigation

</div>
<div>

# Enhancing Resiliency through Architecture

<div class="columns">
<div>

## Fault Isolation

- Prevents cascading failures and maintains availability
- Distributes workloads across multiple data centers
- Handles datacenter-specific failures with built-in mechanisms

</div>
<div>

## Reliability Best Practices

- Deploy across multiple Availability Zones
- Leverage multi-region approaches when necessary
- Use landing zones and reference architectures
- Apply design patterns appropriate to your workload

</div>
</div>

---

# Infrastructure / Platform Layer

## Foundation for Consistent Resilience

Automated, policy-driven environments (Landing Zones, AVM, APRL) reduce variance & misconfiguration risk.

---

# Azure-Customer Shared Responsibility Model

![width:850px center](./img/shared-responsibility.svg)

---

# Azure Regions and Regional Strategy

<div class="columns">
<div>

## Azure Regions

- 60+ regions worldwide with defined data residency boundaries
- Datacenters connected by low-latency, high-capacity networks
- Some regions are sovereign clouds (e.g., Azure Government)
- [Explore Regions](https://datacenters.microsoft.com/globe/explore/)

</div>
<div>

## Region Pairs & Alternatives

- **Region Pairs**: Built-in geo-redundancy (e.g., East US ⟷ West US)
  - Support **sequential updates** and **prioritized recovery**
  - Note: Pairing doesn't guarantee automatic failover
- **Non-paired Regions**: Rely on availability zones
  - Services can replicate across any region combination
  - Choose regions based on business needs and compliance

</div>
</div>

---

# Azure Availability Zones

![width:800px center](img/az-diagram.png)

---

# Azure Availability Zones Infrastructure

- AZs are physically separate datacenters within an Azure region
- Each zone has independent power, cooling, and networking
- Low-latency (<2ms) connections reduce local outage impact
- Not all regions have AZs; verify availability
- [View Region Support](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/reliability/availability-zones-region-support)  

---

# Types of Availability Zone Support

- **Zone-Redundant**: Automatically distributed across zones
- **Zonal**: Pinned to a specific zone
- **Zone-Resilient**: Designed to survive zone failures
- **Non-Zonal (Regional)**: No zone-specific deployment
- [View Services Support](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/reliability/availability-zones-service-support)

---

# Zonal Resources

- Pinned to a specific availability zone.
- Combine multiple zonal deployments for high reliability.

![bg right fit](./img/zonal-1.png)

---

# Zonal Resources

**Customer Responsibilities**:

- Deploy and manage resources in each availability zone
- Configure and manage data replication
- Use a load balancer to distribute requests
- Choose active-passive or active-active models
- Handle failover when an AZ becomes unavailable

![bg right fit](./img/zonal-3.png)

---

# Zone-Redundant Resources

- Spread automatically across multiple availability zones.
- Microsoft manages request distribution and data replication.
- Automatic failover if a zone goes down.

![bg fit right](./img/zone-redundant.png)

---

# Zone-Resilient vs. Non-Zonal (Regional)

<div class="columns">
<div>

## Zone-Resilient

- Created as **zone-redundant** or deployed **zonally** across multiple zones  
- Survives a single zone outage by design  
- Minimizes downtime as data and services continue in healthy zones  

</div>
<div>

## Non-Zonal (Regional)

- Not explicitly configured for zone redundancy  
- May be placed in any zone and moved automatically  
- Resources may go down if that zone experiences an outage  

</div>
</div>

---

# Availability Zones and Azure Updates

## Update Deployment Strategy

- Microsoft deploys updates to one AZ at a time
- Minimizes impact on active workloads
- Running across multiple zones ensures continuous service during updates

---

# Data Replication: Storage Options

![storage options center](img/storage-options.png)

---

# Software / Workload Layer

## Runtime Resilience Behaviors

---

# Load Testing

<div class="columns">
<div>

## Key Benefits

- **Prevents Surprises**: Identify capacity issues before production
- **Validates Scaling**: Ensure your auto-scaling works properly
- **Finds Weaknesses**: Spot resource exhaustion and memory leaks

</div>
<div>

## Implementation

- **Cost-Effective**: Much cheaper than emergency scaling during incidents
- **Azure Tools**: Azure Load Testing service with JMeter support
- **Best Practice**: Test with realistic user patterns and data volumes

</div>
</div>

---

# Chaos Engineering

<div class="columns">
<div>

## Core Principles

- **Controlled Failure**: Introduce failures in controlled environments
- **Best Practice**: Start small with clear abort conditions
- **Continuous Process**: Build complexity as confidence increases

</div>
<div>

## Key Azure Scenarios

- **Availability Zone Outages**: Test region resiliency
- **Network Latency**: Simulate connectivity issues
- **Service Throttling**: Test quota and limit handling
- **Identity Failures**: Test credential expiration response

</div>
</div>

# Resilience Patterns (Software Layer)

| Pattern | Problem Solved | Key Considerations | Azure Example |
|---------|----------------|--------------------|---------------|
| Timeout | Prevent hanging on slow dependency | Set < expected p95 latency; combine with retries | HTTP client / SDK timeout settings |
| Retry + Exponential Backoff + Jitter | Transient faults (throttling, brief network blips) | Cap attempts; respect idempotency | Storage / Service Bus transient errors |
| Circuit Breaker | Failing dependency causing cascading latency | Trip on error rate/latency; half-open probes | Polly / DAPR resiliency policies |
| Bulkhead Isolation | One noisy component starving others | Resource partitioning (threads, pools) | Separate App Service plan / AKS node pool |
| Idempotency Key | Safe retried operations | Persist operation state; expire keys | Queue-triggered Function processing |
| Dead Letter Queue | Poison messages blocking progress | Monitor & replay with alerting | Service Bus DLQ |
| Hedging Request | Long-tail latency outliers | Use sparingly; increases load | Parallel reads from replicated store |
| Graceful Degradation | Maintain partial service | Feature flags, fallback data | Read-only catalog mode |

> Select patterns based on observed failure modes; measure impact via SLIs & error budget consumption.

---

# Resiliency Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Risk Introduced | Better Practice |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Infinite / unbounded retries | Cascading load amplification | Bounded retries + jitter + overall timeout |
| No global timeout | Thread/connection exhaustion | Layered (per attempt + overall) deadlines |
| Single region by default | Regional outage = total downtime | Evaluate multi-AZ then multi-region for critical flows |
| Synchronous fan-out to many services | Latency & failure amplification | Bulkhead & async queue fan-out |
| Hidden coupling via shared database | Coordinated failures & lock contention | Explicit service contracts + data segregation |
| Ignoring throttling signals | Wasted budget, longer recovery | Respect Retry-After & implement backoff |
| Over-provision without observability | Cost drain, false sense of safety | Rightsize with capacity metrics + auto-scale |
| Manual failover only | Slow recovery & human error | Automate failover + rehearse game days |

---

# Azure SDK Resiliency Best Practices

| Concern | Guidance | Notes / Azure SDK Features |
|---------|----------|-----------------------------|
| Retry Policy | Use built-in exponential backoff + jitter; cap total elapsed time | SDK defaults (3–5 retries). Tune max attempts & overall operation timeout |
| Idempotency | Make write & queue ops safely repeatable | Use idempotency keys / message IDs to dedupe |
| Timeouts | Combine per-attempt timeout + overall deadline | Use CancellationToken / request context to abort quickly |
| Throttling (429 / 503) | Honor Retry-After; escalate if sustained | Log retry reason & emit metric for throttled calls |
| Circuit Breaking | Wrap high-risk dependencies with Polly / resilience lib | Trip on error rate/latency. Half-open probes restore flow |
| Connection Reuse | Reuse client instances (thread-safe) | Avoid per-request instantiation to prevent socket exhaustion |
| Observability | Correlate Request-Id / Traceparent; record retry count | Enable SDK logging + OpenTelemetry exporters |
| Partial Failure | Process successes; isolate & retry failed items | Batch ops return per-item status; implement granular retry |
| Backpressure | Limit concurrency & queue length; shed excess | Use bounded channels / semaphores; fail fast when saturated |

> Engineer for transient failure as the norm: fast fail, bounded retries, measurable outcomes.

# Operations & Observability Layer

## Detect, Respond, Learn

Emphasize fast detection, validated recovery paths, and continuous improvement through data & drills.

---

## [Azure Service Groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/service-groups/overview)

<div class="columns">
<div>

### Health Metrics Aggregation

- **Cross-environment health**: Aggregate health metrics from multiple apps and environments
- **Resource type inventory**: Unified views across subscriptions
- **Unified monitoring**: Single Service Group provides health visibility across management groups

</div>
<div>

### Least-Privilege Access

- **Selective permissions**: Service Groups don't inherit member permissions
- **Role-based viewing**: Assign different users access to same Service Group with varying resource visibility
- **Monitoring metrics**: Apply minimal privileges for metrics access without resource management rights

</div>
</div>

---

## [Mission-Critical Health Modeling](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/mission-critical/mission-critical-health-modeling)

<div class="columns">
<div>

### Core Concepts

- **Layered health model**: Define health from individual resources to user flows
- **Business-aligned scoring**: Health reflects business priorities with clear healthy/unhealthy states
- **Automated calculation**: Use metrics and thresholds for real-time health scores

</div>
<div>

### Implementation

- **Unified observability**: Aggregate logs, metrics, traces in Log Analytics workspaces
- **Visual dashboards**: Azure Monitor or Grafana for real-time insights
- **Proactive response**: Integrate with alerting and automated incident response

</div>
</div>

---

# Metrics & Error Budgets

| Concept | Formula / Definition | Example |
|---------|----------------------|---------|
| Availability SLI | (Successful Requests) / (Total Requests) | 99,950 / 100,000 = 99.95% |
| Latency SLI | % of requests under threshold | 95% < 250ms (p95), 99% < 400ms |
| Error Budget  | 1 - SLO | SLO 99.9% => 0.1% budget |
| Burn Rate | Budget consumed / Time elapsed fraction | 2× burn -> intervene early |
| MTTR | Avg restore time for incidents | Track trend downwards |

Error Budget Response Guide:
- Burn Rate > 4× for 1h: Freeze risky deploys; incident review.
- Burn Rate 2× sustained: Reduce change volume; add mitigations.
- Burn Rate nominal (<1×): Continue roadmap; schedule chaos tests.

---

<div class="columns">
<div>

## Business Benefits

- **Early Issue Detection**: Find problems before customers do
- **Increased Confidence**: Better team preparedness for incidents
- **Reduced Recovery Time**: Faster MTTR during real outages
- **Trust Building**: Demonstrate resilience to stakeholders

</div>
<div>

## Practical Implementation

- **Start Simple**: Begin with critical paths and core functions
