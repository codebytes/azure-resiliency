# Reliability

![bg right:65%](./img/sb-reliability.jpg)

---

# Why Reliability Matters

> A system is considered "reliable" if it can consistently serve users under normal or abnormal conditions.

- Reliability in distributed systems involves:
  - **Consistent performance** despite failures.
  - **Graceful degradation** when certain components become unavailable.
  - **Rapid recovery** within acceptable time limits.

---

# Understanding Reliability and Resiliency

- Failures are **inevitable** in distributed systems
- Workloads must **detect**, **withstand**, and **recover** from failures within _**acceptable**_ timeframes
- Ensuring availability for users to access workloads as promised
- Failures impact _**revenue**_, _**reputation**_, and _**customer trust**_

---

# <!-- fit --> FAILURE IS ALWAYS AN OPTION

---

## Financial Impact of Downtime

- **Revenue Loss**: Downtime can cost businesses over $1 million per hour, especially for e-commerce and online services.
- **Increased Expenses**: Includes emergency maintenance, staff overtime, and potential penalties for SLA breaches.
- **Legal Liabilities**: Potential lawsuits from customers or clients affected by downtime.
- **Insurance Challenges**: Downtime can affect insurance coverage and premiums.
- **Operational Costs**: Additional costs for restoring systems, data recovery, and preventive measures to avoid future downtime.

---

## Real-World Downtime Costs

- **77 hours** (≈3 days) median annual downtime for high-impact outages
- **$146 million** median annual cost of outages
- **30%** of engineering time spent addressing disruptions
  - Equals **12 hours** per engineer weekly (based on 40-hour week)

# How Do We Measure Reliability?

![bg right:20% fit](./img/sla-slo-sli.png)

| SLI | SLO | Error Budget | SLA |
|---------------|--------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Service Level Indicator | Service Level Objective | 1 - SLO (consumable failure/time) | Service Level Agreement |
| Metric of user experience (e.g., success %, p95 latency) | Reliability goal over window (e.g., 99.9% / 30d) | Remaining time/requests that may fail before action | Contract / credits / penalties |
| Assess actual service quality | Define acceptable reliability | Govern release pace & risk appetite | Formalize promises & remedies |
| API success rate per request | 99.95% successful responses (30d) | 0.05% errors ≈21.9 min @ 99.95% | 99.9% monthly availability w/ credits |

---

# Understanding RPOs and RTOs

- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: Maximum acceptable downtime before services must be restored
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: Maximum acceptable data loss during a disruption

# Enhancing Resiliency through Architecture

<div class="columns">
<div>

## Fault Isolation

- Prevents cascading failures and maintains availability
- Distributes workloads across multiple data centers
- Handles datacenter-specific failures with built-in mechanisms

</div>
<div>

## Reliability Best Practices

- Deploy across multiple Availability Zones
- Leverage multi-region approaches when necessary
- Use landing zones and reference architectures
- Apply design patterns appropriate to your workload

</div>
</div>

---

# Infrastructure / Platform Layer

## Foundation for Consistent Resilience

Automated, policy-driven environments (Landing Zones, AVM, APRL) reduce variance & misconfiguration risk.

# Azure-Customer Shared Responsibility Model

<div class="columns">
<div>

![width:500px](./img/shared-responsibility.svg)


> Azure guarantees platform SLA; you own workload SLA

</div>
<div>

## Your Reliability Responsibilities

| Layer | Customer Owns |
|-------|---------------|
| **Data** | Backup strategy, replication, encryption |
| **Application** | Retry logic, circuit breakers, health probes |
| **Identity** | MFA, conditional access, break-glass accounts |
| **Network** | Redundant paths, ExpressRoute resilience |
| **Infra Config** | Zone/region selection, scaling rules |

</div>
</div>

---

# Azure Regions and Regional Strategy

<div class="columns">
<div>

## Region Selection Criteria

- **Latency**: Proximity to users (measure with [Azure Speed Test](https://www.azurespeed.com/))
- **Compliance**: Data residency, sovereignty requirements
- **Service Availability**: Not all services in all regions
- **Capacity**: Some regions have quota constraints
- **Cost**: Pricing varies by region

</div>
<div>

## Multi-Region Considerations

| Factor | Impact on Design |
|--------|------------------|
| Region Pairs | Sequential updates, prioritized recovery |
| Non-paired | Flexible, but plan your own DR |
| Sovereign Clouds | Isolated (Gov, China, Germany) |
| Distance | Affects replication lag & latency |

> Pairing ≠ automatic failover—you must design for it

</div>
</div>

---

# Azure Availability Zones

![width:800px center](img/az-diagram.png)

---

# Azure Availability Zones Infrastructure

- AZs are physically separate datacenters within an Azure region
- Each zone has independent power, cooling, and networking
- Low-latency (<2ms) connections reduce local outage impact
- Azure deploys updates one AZ at a time for continuous service
- Not all regions have AZs; verify availability
- [View Region Support](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/reliability/availability-zones-region-support)  

---

# Types of Availability Zone Support

- **Zone-Redundant**: Automatically distributed across zones
- **Zonal**: Pinned to a specific zone
- **Zone-Resilient**: Designed to survive zone failures
- **Non-Zonal (Regional)**: No zone-specific deployment
- [View Services Support](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/reliability/availability-zones-service-support)

---

# Zonal Resources

- Pinned to a specific availability zone.
- Combine multiple zonal deployments for high reliability.

![bg right fit](./img/zonal-1.png)

---

# Zonal Resources

**Customer Responsibilities**:

- Deploy and manage resources in each availability zone
- Configure and manage data replication
- Use a load balancer to distribute requests
- Choose active-passive or active-active models
- Handle failover when an AZ becomes unavailable

![bg right fit](./img/zonal-3.png)

---

# Zone-Redundant Resources

- Spread automatically across multiple availability zones.
- Microsoft manages request distribution and data replication.
- Automatic failover if a zone goes down.

![bg fit right](./img/zone-redundant.png)

---

# Zone-Resilient vs. Non-Zonal (Regional)

<div class="columns">
<div>

## Zone-Resilient

- Created as **zone-redundant** or deployed **zonally** across multiple zones  
- Survives a single zone outage by design  
- Minimizes downtime as data and services continue in healthy zones  

</div>
<div>

## Non-Zonal (Regional)

- Not explicitly configured for zone redundancy  
- May be placed in any zone and moved automatically  
- Resources may go down if that zone experiences an outage  

</div>
</div>

---

# Data Replication: Storage Options

<div class="columns">
<div>

![width:500px](img/storage-options.png)

</div>
<div>

## Choosing the Right Option

| Option | RPO | Use Case |
|--------|-----|----------|
| **LRS** | 0 (sync) | Dev/test, easily reconstructed data |
| **ZRS** | 0 (sync) | Production, zone-level protection |
| **GRS/GZRS** | ~15 min | DR across regions, read-access optional |

**Key Decisions**:
- Hot vs. Cool vs. Archive affects recovery time
- RA-GRS enables read from secondary during outage
- Immutable storage for ransomware protection

</div>
</div>

---

# Software / Workload Layer

## Runtime Resilience Behaviors

---

# Load Testing

<div class="columns">
<div>

## Key Benefits

- **Prevents Surprises**: Identify capacity issues before production
- **Validates Scaling**: Ensure your auto-scaling works properly

</div>
<div>

## Implementation

- **Cost-Effective**: Much cheaper than emergency scaling during incidents
- **Azure Tools**: Azure Load Testing service with JMeter support
- **Best Practice**: Test with realistic user patterns and data volumes

</div>
</div>

---

# Chaos Engineering

<div class="columns">
<div>

## Core Principles

- **Controlled Failure**: Introduce failures in controlled environments
- **Best Practice**: Start small with clear abort conditions
- **Continuous Process**: Build complexity as confidence increases

</div>
<div>

## Key Azure Scenarios

- **Availability Zone Outages**: Test region resiliency
- **Network Latency**: Simulate connectivity issues
- **Service Throttling**: Test quota and limit handling
- **Identity Failures**: Test credential expiration response

</div>
</div>

---

# Resilience Patterns
| Pattern | Problem Solved | Key Considerations |
|---------|----------------|--------------------|
| Timeout | Prevent hanging on slow dependency | Set < expected p95 latency; combine with retries | HTTP client / SDK timeout settings |
| Retry + Exponential Backoff + Jitter | Transient faults (throttling, brief network blips) | Cap attempts; respect idempotency |
| Circuit Breaker | Failing dependency causing cascading latency | Trip on error rate/latency; half-open probes |
| Bulkhead Isolation | One noisy component  | Resource partitioning |
| Dead Letter Queue | Bad messages blocking progress | Monitor & replay with alerting |
| Graceful Degradation | Maintain partial service | Feature flags, fallback data |

> Select patterns based on observed failure modes; measure impact via SLIs & error budget consumption.

---

# Azure SDK Resiliency Best Practices

| Concern | Guidance | Notes / Azure SDK Features |
|---------|----------|-----------------------------|
| Retry Policy | Use built-in exponential backoff + jitter; cap total elapsed time | SDK defaults (3–5 retries). Tune max attempts & overall operation timeout |
| Idempotency | Make write & queue ops safely repeatable | Use idempotency keys / message IDs to dedupe |
| Timeouts | Combine per-attempt timeout + overall deadline | Use CancellationToken / request context to abort quickly |
| Throttling (429 / 503) | Honor Retry-After; escalate if sustained | Log retry reason & emit metric for throttled calls |
| Circuit Breaking | Wrap high-risk dependencies with Polly / resilience lib | Trip on error rate/latency. Half-open probes restore flow |

---

# Azure SDK Resiliency Best Practices Continued

| Concern | Guidance | Notes / Azure SDK Features |
|---------|----------|-----------------------------|
| Connection Reuse | Reuse client instances (thread-safe) | Avoid per-request instantiation to prevent socket exhaustion |
| Observability | Correlate Request-Id / Traceparent; record retry count | Enable SDK logging + OpenTelemetry exporters |
| Partial Failure | Process successes; isolate & retry failed items | Batch ops return per-item status; implement granular retry |
| Backpressure | Limit concurrency & queue length; shed excess | Use bounded channels / semaphores; fail fast when saturated |

> Engineer for transient failure as the norm: fast fail, bounded retries, measurable outcomes.

---

# Operations & Observability Layer

## Detect, Respond, Learn

Emphasize fast detection, validated recovery paths, and continuous improvement through data & drills.

---

# OpenTelemetry

- Open standard for generating, collecting, and exporting telemetry data (traces, metrics, logs)
- Supported by major cloud providers, including Azure Monitor, AWS CloudWatch, and Google Cloud Operations
- Enables vendor-neutral instrumentation and observability across distributed systems

---

# Metrics & Error Budgets

| Concept | Formula / Definition | Example |
|---------|----------------------|---------|
| Availability SLI | (Successful Requests) / (Total Requests) | 99,950 / 100,000 = 99.95% |
| Latency SLI | % of requests under threshold | 95% < 250ms (p95), 99% < 400ms |
| Error Budget  | 1 - SLO | SLO 99.9% => 0.1% budget |
| Burn Rate | Budget consumed / Time elapsed fraction | 2× burn -> intervene early |
| MTTR | Avg restore time for incidents | Track trend downwards |

Error Budget Response Guide:
- Burn Rate > 4× for 1h: Freeze risky deploys; incident review.
- Burn Rate 2× sustained: Reduce change volume; add mitigations.
- Burn Rate nominal (<1×): Continue roadmap; schedule chaos tests.
